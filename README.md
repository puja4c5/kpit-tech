# 🚗 EV Buddy - Your Smart AI Voice Assistant for Electric Vehicles

**EV Buddy** is a multilingual AI-powered voice assistant designed for modern electric vehicles (EVs). It helps drivers understand vehicle issues in **natural, spoken language** — not confusing error codes or warning lights. Think of it as your **virtual mechanic**, ready to guide you whenever your EV runs into trouble.



## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern EVs are packed with technology, but users often don’t understand the error codes or warning lights they display. For example:
> “Battery Warning Code 47B” — What does that even mean?

This leads to **driver confusion**, **delays in addressing safety issues**, and **low confidence** in EV usage—especially in non-English-speaking regions.



## 💡 Our Solution: EV Buddy

**EV Buddy** is a voice assistant that:
- **Understands vehicle issues** using natural language input
- **Explains solutions in simple, regional languages**
- **Speaks instructions out loud** so drivers don’t need to read
- **Guides users step-by-step** during emergencies (e.g., battery overheating, brake failure)
